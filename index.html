       <h1 id="despacito">Intro</h1>
       <p>The subject that my passion project is about is video games. This subject is very important to me because it is the predominant thing that I do in my free time. It is also important to me because knowledge of game design and game development can help me in other fields involving technology.</p>

       <h1 id="h">What Was the Reason For the Video Game Crash of 1983?</h1>
<!-- Gucci gang -->
       <p>Before we know the cause of the video game crash of 1983, we need to know what the crash is. The video game crash of 1983 is the recession of the video game industry that happened in 1983. </p>
       <h2>What happened for the industry to recover?</h2>
       <p>The video game industry has recovered mostly because of the Nintendo Entertainment System, which was released in the US in 1985.</p>
       <h2>What were the causes for the video game crash?</h2>
       <p>The main causes for the video game crash were the lack of quality control, the vast amount of consoles, and the competition from personal computers.</p>
       <h3><u>Console Market</u></h3>
       <p>There were too many consoles with their own separate libraries. There is limited space for retailers to handle, and they are unable to display and sell all their inventory. Game developers are also pressured to make games with more depth. The oversaturation caused only a select few to succeed.</p>
       <h3><u>PC Competition</u></h3>
       <p>Competition with PC’s were a major factor in the crash. Computer parts were getting cheaper and cheaper, and so were PC’s. However, console prices were stagnant. This caused PC’s to become more popular and consoles less so.</p>
       <h3><u>Quality Control</u></h3>
       <p>The lack of quality control in games caused large sums of money to be lost to critical and financial failures, and also flooded the market, causing otherwise successful games to fall into obscurity. The biggest failures, E.T and Pac Man for the Atari 2600, were bad enough that they tarnished the reputation of the console itself.</p>
       <h2>What did Nintendo do differently?</h2>
       <p>The NES was the American counterpart to the Famicom, released in 1983. The Famicom is a home console in Japan that was successful, as the crash mostly affected American consumers. NIntendo knew that they could increase their profits if they sold to the American public, but they knew they would be a failure if they released in America at the time. </p>
       <h3><u>Unique Marketing</u></h3>
       <p>Instead of marketing as a video game console, they marketed the system as a toy, bundled with a toy gun and a toy robot. The system also looked much more mature than the Japanese counterpart, with a grey, boxy design. Both decisions encouraged consumers, which many considered consoles to be of no value. </p>
       <h3><u>Tough Quality Control</u></h3>
       <p>They also implemented a system of quality control so that offensive and broken games did not get released. Third party developers had to be licensed to develop for the system, they could not develop for other platforms, and could only release games twice a year. They could also not have inappropriate content. Eventually, developers got around this by releasing unofficial cartridges, but for the time, their quality control was excellent, and far beyond the competition.</p>

      <h1 id="fortnite">What problems does the video game industry face that other media does not?</h1>
      <p>The video game industry has many problems that similar forms of media, such as movies and books, do not. Most of these problems are related to interactivity, which other media does not have.</p>
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>Many video games over the decades have unsatisfying stories. Many of these games have had bad stories because of bad writing, but many others would have a good story, if made as a book or movie. However, their stories suffer thanks to interactivity. If you want your video game to stay faithful to the story, then your game is very linear, which may cause the story to feel different than intended. The mechanics of the game should also connect to the story. If you want your game to be open world, then your story must be fragmented as a result. Because of interactivity, most stories in video games are compromised.</p>
      <h2>Presentation</h2>
      <p>A game’s aesthetics is crucial to the game, if you do not understand what you are seeing, you cannot make informed judgement. The problem with a game’s aesthetics is that it is limited by the hardware running it. With a video game, you have to make textures lower and lower resolution as they get farther away, as well as many other things. With a movie, however, any device capable of rendering video is able to run a movie, because the movie is only a video. The movie only has to be rendered once, so they run it on hardware much more powerful hardware. </p>
      <div>
        <p>However, that problem pales in comparison to the animation in a video game. With a movie, the makers know where every shot is being taken, and what actions the characters are doing, at any given time. However, in a video game, thanks to interactivity, that knowledge is gone. With a video game, you have to make the animations fluid and flexible and make the animation look good from all angles, if your game is 3D. The biggest problem is how long the animations take. If you press the a button, the action should be instantaneous, usually disregarding some of the fluidness in the animation. The animation should look good, without hindering the gameplay.</p>

      <h1 id="dab">How is the industry affected by new technologies?</h1>
      <p>The industry is affected by new technologies often. Sometimes, it is a fad, but often, these technologies stay and permanently affect the industry.</p>
      <h2>Smartphones</h2>
      <p>Smartphones have undoubtedly changed the video game industry. They have made an entirely new platform for video games, dominated by free to play games. They have brought many things to the game industry, even to other platforms.</p>
      <h3><u>Microtransactions</u></h3>
      <p>Microtransactions have been introduced to the video game industry mostly because of free to play games on the iPhone and Android systems. First popularized in MMO games, they quickly became used in mobile gaming spaces. Nowadays, many triple A games include them. </p>
      <h3><u>Play times</u></h3>
      <p>Thanks in part to smartphones, video games nowadays are being cut into bite-size chunks, with levels finishable in small play sessions, compared to console or PC games. This is because of the more portable nature of smartphones compared to consoles or PCs. </p>
      <h2>The Internet</h2>
      <p>There are too many examples of how the video game industry is affected by the Internet, thus we will only list some of the most prominent examples.</p>
      <h3><u>Online Multiplayer</u></h3>
      <p>Playing online with friends and strangers has forever changed the video game industry. It has revolutionized the FPS genre, it is the reason that MMO’s exist, and fewer and fewer games being released do not include an online function.</p>
      <h3><u>Digital Distribution</u></h3>
      <p>Before digital distribution, you had to go to the store to buy a video game, and you had less options. Nowadays, Steam and the Play store are filled with many games, available whenever you have an Internet connection. Before, you had to be relatively known to be found at a major retailer because of limited space, but with digital distribution, almost everyone can release a game. </p>
      <h2>Fads/Gimmicks</h2>
      <p>Though most new technologies get used at least somewhat, some technologies are used infrequently and are more often ignored than used. They are usually unique and interesting, but not essential. Many are bundled with a console or game to help sell units, and while they often work, they rarely stick around for long. Examples of these technologies are the N64 Rumble Pak and the Nintendo 3DS’s 3D feature.</p>
